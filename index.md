Doctorate in Nutrition and Food. I graduated from the [University of Chile](https://medicina.uchile.cl/school-of-medicine/undergraduate-school/nutrition-and-dietetics). Now I live in Bern, Switzerland.
My research profile is related to the field of healthy food. I did my research under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Martin Gotteland.
My doctoral thesis is about the protective effect of proanthocyanidins against the deleterious effect of a high protein diet.
I am open to extending my knowledge to other research areas.

The list of my publications is available on [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wsH4ME4AAAAJ&hl=es) and [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=María+José+Cires).
