Doctorate in Nutrition and Food. I graduated from the University of Chile. Now I live in Bern,Switzerland.
My research profile is related to the field of healthy food. I did my research under the supervision of Dr. Martin Gotteland.
My doctoral thesis was about the protective effect of proanthocyanidins against the deleterious effect of a high protein diet.
I am open to extending my knowledge to other areas of research.

My list of publication is available on [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wsH4ME4AAAAJ&hl=es).
